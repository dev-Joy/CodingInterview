# [608. Tree Node](https://leetcode.com/problems/tree-node/)

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT
    id AS `Id`,
    CASE
        WHEN tree.id = (SELECT atree.id FROM tree atree WHERE atree.p_id IS NULL)
          THEN 'Root'
        WHEN tree.id IN (SELECT atree.p_id FROM tree atree)
          THEN 'Inner'
        ELSE 'Leaf'
    END AS Type

# Solution 2
SELECT
