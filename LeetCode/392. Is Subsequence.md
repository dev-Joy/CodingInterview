# Two Pointers Approach
class Solution:
    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        i = j = 0
        while i < len(s) and j < len(t):
            if s[i] == t[j]:
                i += 1
            j += 1

        return i == len(s)
            
            
# Using iter, all            
class Solution:
    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        t = iter(t)
        return all(c in t for c in s)
